        <p class="section-text">
            Coldplay Christmas Bash 2025 is a special holiday edition concert imagined as a 
            colourful mix of Coldplay’s stadium energy and the cozy warmth of Christmas.
            The show blends a full-length Coldplay live performance with Christmas
            storytelling, visuals and interactive moments for the audience.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            The night features custom visuals inspired by the <em>Music of the Spheres</em> tour, 
            but re-designed with Christmas colours – red, green and gold. Fans receive LED 
            wristbands that sync with the music, turning the entire arena into a moving light 
            show. Snow cannons, confetti storms and surprise Christmas carols appear between
            songs to keep the crowd hyped and involved.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            Along with the concert, there are festive zones around the venue including a 
            hot chocolate bar, holiday photo booths, charity gift drop-off, and a “Wish Wall”
            where fans can write their Christmas wishes that light up on the big screens.
            The goal is simple – to end the year together with music, kindness and pure
            Christmas joy.
